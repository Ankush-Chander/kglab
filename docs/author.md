There are several [contributors](../ack/) on this **kglab** project, 
and an even larger scope of [use cases](../use_case/) represented by its community.
Many thanks to all.

As an author/speaker/instructor, Paco has taught many people (+9000) 
in industry across a range of topics –
[*data science*](../glossary/#data-science),
[*natural language*](../glossary/#natural-language),
[*cloud computing*](../glossary/#cloud-computing),
[*reinforcement learning*](../glossary/#reinforcement-learning),
[*computable content*](../glossary/#computable-content),
etc. –
and through guest lectures at 
Stanford, CMU, UC&nbsp;Berkeley,
U&nbsp;da&nbsp;Coruña, U&nbsp;Manchester,
KTH, NYU, GWU,
U&nbsp;Maryland, Cal&nbsp;Poly, UT/Austin,
U&nbsp;Virginia, CU&nbsp;Boulder.

You'll find elements from most of the above woven throughout this
[**kglab** tutorial](../tutorial/):
data science, business context, AI applications, 
data management, design, distributed systems,
and opportunities for leveraging advanced math.

To that extent, **kglab** is a follow-up edition of 
[*Just Enough Math*](../biblio/#nathan2014jem) (2014)
which had the elevator pitch: 

> practical uses of advanced math for business execs (who probably didn't take +3 years of calculus) to understand big data use cases through hands-on coding experience plus case studies, histories of the key innovations and their innovators, and links to primary sources

[*JEM*](../biblio/#nathan2014jem) started as a book which –
thanks to quick thinking by editor Ann Spencer – 
turned into a popular video+notebook series,
followed by tutorials, and then a community focused on open source.
This time around, **kglab** starts as an open source Python library,
with a notebook-based tutorial at its core,
focused on a community and their business use cases.
Perhaps someday it may spin-out a book or other learning materials.

YMMV.
