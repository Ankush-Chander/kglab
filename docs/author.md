As an author/speaker/instructor, Paco has taught many people (+9000) in industry 
in a range of topics – *data science*, *natural language*, *reinforcement learning*, *computable content* –
and guest lectures at Stanford, CMU, UC Berkeley, KTH, U Manchester, 
U da Coruña, U Maryland, Cal Poly, UT/Austin, U Virginia, CU Boulder.

You'll find elements from most of the above woven into this
[**kglab** tutorial](../tutorial/):
data science, AI applications, business perspective, advanced math, 
data management, design, distributed systems.
To that extent, **kglab** is a follow-up edition of 
[*Just Enough Math*](https://derwen.ai/jem) (2014)
which had the elevator pitch: 

> practical advanced math for business execs, who didn't take 3 years of calculus, to understand big data use cases through hands-on coding experience

... presented as a video+notebook series.
This time around, these materials are presented as an open source Python library.
YMMV.
