## Just Enough Math, Edition 2

You'll find elements from most of the above woven throughout this
[**kglab** tutorial](../tutorial/):
data science, business context, AI applications, 
data management, design, distributed systems,
and opportunities for leveraging advanced math.

To that extent, **kglab** is a follow-up edition of 
[*Just Enough Math*](../biblio/#nathan2014jem) (2014)
which had the elevator pitch: 

> practical uses of advanced math for business execs (who probably didn't take +3 years of calculus) to understand big data use cases through hands-on coding experience plus case studies, histories of the key innovations and their innovators, and links to primary sources

[*JEM*](../biblio/#nathan2014jem) started as a book which –
thanks to quick thinking by editor Ann Spencer – 
turned into a popular video+notebook series,
followed by tutorials, and then a community focused on open source.
Seven years later the field of 
[data science](../glossary/#data-science)
has changed dramatically
This time around, **kglab** starts as an open source Python library,
with a notebook-based tutorial at its core,
focused on a community and their business use cases.

The scope now is about [*graph-based data science*](../glossary/#graph-based-data-science),
and perhaps someday this may spin-out a book or other learning materials.
