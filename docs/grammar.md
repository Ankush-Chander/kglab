A Grammar of Learning

## How to use these materials

Following the *JEM* approach, throughout the tutorial you'll find a
mix of topics:
data science, business context, AI applications, data management, 
design, distributed systems – plus explorations of how to leverage
relatively advanced math, where appropriate.

This builds on the ["Graph-Based Data Science"](https://derwen.ai/s/kcgh) talks at conferences and meetups, which experiment with the content that eventually goes here.

A "documentation" strategy guided by:

  * <https://documentation.divio.com/>
  * <https://slab.com/blog/stripe-writing-culture/>
  * <https://blog.cloudflare.com/new-and-improved-workers-docs/>
  * <https://calmtech.com/>

Based on these other projects as guiance, this documentation leverages the structure and dynamics shown in the following figure:

To make these materials useful to a wide audience, we've provided
multiple entry points, depending on what you need:

  * [explanation](../concepts): explanations that introduce concepts, exploring the math and processes behind their usage
	- *What's a Knowledge Graph?*
	- *Concepts*
  * [technical reference](../ref): each type, class, and parameter is listed and explained with plenty of whitespace for readability
	- *Package Reference*: generated from *apidocs* (which probably need customizing)
	- *Dependencies*
  * [how-to guides](../howto): problem-oriented directions for getting things done
	- *Getting Started*
	- *Build Instructions*
	- specific "howto" articles, generated from notebooks
  * [tutorials](../tutorial/): learning-oriented practice through hands-on coding exercises, based on a *progressive example*
	- based on *learning promise* styled syllabus
	- generated from notebooks, which provide reusable sample code and supplemental exercises
  * [use cases](../use_case): explore use cases and link to related case studies for grounding in industry applications
  * [glossary](../glossary): clarify terminology with shared definitions and their supporting links
  * [primary sources](../biblio): point toward original papers, histories, notable authors, and other materials for context
	- generated from a KG
  * [search/discovery](../disc): indexing, search, recommendations, navigation

   * [community support](../foo):
	- open source governance, focused on discussions on the GitHub repo [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DerwenAI/kglab/issues)
	- [*Graph-Based Data Science*](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6725785/) group on LinkedIn – join to receive related updates, news, conference coupons, etc.
	- [community Slack](https://knowledgegraphconf.slack.com/ssb/redirect) discussions
	- [Knowledge Tech Q&A site](https://answers.knowledgegraph.tech/) for extended discussions
	- ["knowledge espresso"](https://www.notion.so/KG-Community-Events-Calendar-8aacbe22efa94d9b8b39b7288e22c2d3) (monthly office hours) with [Paco Nathan](ack/#project-lead) and others involved in this open source project

  * [feedback](../foo):
	- *self-assessments* for personal feedback
	- *certfication exam*
	- *surveys* for feedback about improving the learning material
	-  instructor personal recommendation on social media

Ideally, there should also be other parts – stay tuned:

  * the coding examples show lead into a *capstone project*

In any case, the objective for these materials is to help people learn
how leverage **kglab** effectively, gain confidence working with
graph-based data science, plus have examples to repurpose for your own
use cases.

Start at any point, whatever is most immediately useful for you.
The material is hyper-linked together; it may be helpful to run
JupyterLab for the coding examples in one browser tab, while reading
this documentation in another browser tab.

## Background

 > There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software documentation: there isn’t one thing called documentation, there are *four*.
 > They are: *tutorials*, *how-to guides*, *technical reference* and *explanation*. They represent four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the implications of this will help improve most documentation - often immensely.

> Their strong writing culture benefits the organization in several areas:

  1. Time efficiency. Sharing ideas through writing eliminates the need for repetitive verbal updates to disseminate ideas and information.
  2. Knowledge sharing. Documenting important ideas forces clarity of thought and makes information more accessible to everyone in the company, versus slide decks that are ephemeral and require less rigor of thought.
  3. Communication. Clear writing requires clear thinking, meaning employees invest more time shaping their ideas before sharing them.
