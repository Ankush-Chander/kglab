# Graph Concepts

The primary abstractions used in **kglab** are based on a small set of
Python classes:

  * [`kglab.KnowledgeGraph`](../ref/#KnowledgeGraph) -- TBD
  * [`kglab.Measure`](../ref/#Measure) -- TBD
  * [`kglab.Subgraph`](../ref/#Subgraph) -- TBD

These class definitions can be subclassed and extended to handle
specific use cases as needed.
