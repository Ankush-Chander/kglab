# Graph Concepts

## DRAFT: Work in progress

This material is a work in progress, at "rough draft" stage.


The primary abstractions used in **kglab** are based on a small set of
Python classes.
These class definitions can be subclassed and extended to handle
specific use cases as needed.


## Knowledge Graph

  * [`kglab.KnowledgeGraph`](../ref/#KnowledgeGraph)

construction of *RDF graphs*
also handle *property graph*

*representation*
*semantic technologies*
*serialization*
*querying*
*validation*


## Measure

  * [`kglab.Measure`](../ref/#Measure)

*topology*
*statistics*


## Subgraph

  * [`kglab.Subgraph`](../ref/#Subgraph)

*visualization*
*graph algorithms*
*probabilistic graph inference*
*embedding*
