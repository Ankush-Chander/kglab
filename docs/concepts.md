# Graph Concepts

## DRAFT: Work in progress

This material is a work in progress, at "rough draft" stage.


## Class Abstractions

The primary abstractions used in **kglab** are based on a small set of
Python classes.
These class definitions can be subclassed and extended to handle
specific use cases as needed.


### Knowledge Graph

[`kglab.KnowledgeGraph`](../ref/#knowledgegraph-class)

construction of *RDF graphs*
also handle *property graph*

  * *representation*
  * *semantic technologies*
  * *serialization*
  * *querying*
  * *validation*


### Measure

[`kglab.Measure`](../ref/#measure-class)

  * *topology*
  * *statistics*


### Subgraph

[`kglab.Subgraph`](../ref/#subgraph-class)

  * *label encoding*
  * *visualization*
  * *graph algorithms*
  * *probabilistic graph inference*
  * *embedding*
