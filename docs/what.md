# What is a Knowledge Graph?

Gartner Research began to acknowledge the term 
[*knowledge graph*](https://derwen.ai/d/knowledge_graph) 
in 2018, and in mid-2020
described the importance of KGs for developing [AI
applications](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3985680/how-to-build-knowledge-graphs-that-enable-ai-driven-ente).

However, it's not clear when Gartner will acknowledge the breadth of
industry adoption for KG approaches in enterprise data management.

To paraphrase [Natasha Noy](https://research.google/people/NatalyaNoy/), 
a research scientist at Google Research and highly-regarded practitioner 
in this field:

> An "enterprise knowledge graph" provides *ground truth* through which we can reconcile our queries and other usage of many disparate data stores.

For example, having *persistent identifiers* with other metadata
attached is a great start.

KGs allow for multiple teams to be working concurrently, i.e., with
less centralized control.

This is in contrast to legacy notion about 
[*one size fits all*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_size_fits_all) 
(OSFA) for data management.

To wit, the best way to make data consistent is not to import *all* of
the data sources into a single data management framework, where one
individual determines the schema and other data management rules.


## Data Context

["data context"]( http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p111-hellerstein-cidr17.pdf) â€“ 

In a world where organizations must be resilient in the face of abrupt
changes, we must adapt more resilient means for reconciling data from
a wide variety of sources: vendors, customers, partners, government
agencies, standards bodies, and so on.

KGs provide means for a kind of *abstraction layer* to make the data
cohere.
