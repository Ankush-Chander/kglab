# What is a Knowledge Graph?

Gartner Research began to acknowledge the term 
[*knowledge graph*](https://derwen.ai/d/knowledge_graph) 
in 2018, and in mid-2020
described the importance of KGs for developing [AI
applications](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3985680/how-to-build-knowledge-graphs-that-enable-ai-driven-ente).

KGs allow for multiple teams to be working concurrently, i.e., with
less centralized control.

This is in contrast to legacy notion about 
[*one size fits all*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_size_fits_all) 
(OSFA) for data management.

To wit, the best way to make data consistent is not to import *all* of
the data sources into a single data management framework, where one
individual determines the schema and other data management rules.
