# Welcome to `kglab`


## Graph-Based Data Science

The **kglab** library provides a simple abstraction layer in Python
for building and using *knowledge graphs*. 

Our main goal is to leverage idiomatic Python for common use cases in
data work that require graph data, to present *graph-based data
science* as an emerging practice.

On the one hand, **kglab** integrates with popular graph libraries,
including RDFlib, NetworkX, PyVis, pslpython, OWL-RL, etc., while
attempting to make them more compatible with contemporary distributed
systems practices and cloud computing.

On the other hand, this library provides close integrations and
example code for the PyData stack (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn,
etc.) plus other popular data science and data engineering tools,
including spaCy, Ray, Apache Spark, Apache Arrow, and so on.


## Graph Abstractions

The primary abstractions used in **kglab** are based on a small set of
Python classes:

  * `KnowledgeGraph`
  * `Measure`
  * `Subgraph`
