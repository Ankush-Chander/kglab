the following are a few hints that will help you cook the best hardboiled eggs:

the fresher the egg, the harder it will be to peal it. you should purchase your eggs 2 weeks before you'll be cooking them in order to get them to peal easy.

and, the way to get the yolk to be in the center of the egg after it's boiled, is to store them on their side. this relieves the pressure on the membrane within the egg that holds it suspended.

the green coloring on the outside of the yolk is caused by cooking them too long. cooking by the directions below will eliminate that.
