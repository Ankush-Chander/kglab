for creme caramel: pour the syrup (carefully! its hot!) into individual custard cups and swirl the cups around to line with the syrup, which will immediately harden. or, line a larger baking dish. pour the custard over and bake in the oven according to your traditional recipe. (i have cooked the custards themselves in the microwave as well without problem, but i seem to prefer the oven method.) 

for creme brulee: pour the syrup slowly over the top of a baked custard so that it makes a thin smooth layer of hardened caramel. (this is a non-traditional way to get the ""burned"" sugar topping, but its a lot easier than all the other complicated ways i have tried with varied results. i love tapping the hard caramel with a spoon when i eat it. it crackles and shatters, making a wonderful contrast with the rich and smooth custard underneath -- my favorite dessert!)

the following are a few hints that will help you cook the best hardboiled eggs:

the fresher the egg, the harder it will be to peal it. you should purchase your eggs 2 weeks before you'll be cooking them in order to get them to peal easy.

and, the way to get the yolk to be in the center of the egg after it's boiled, is to store them on their side. this relieves the pressure on the membrane within the egg that holds it suspended.

the green coloring on the outside of the yolk is caused by cooking them too long. cooking by the directions below will eliminate that.

my modification to the original was to try using a 9 x 13 pan rather than chilling, rolling out, and cutting into shapes. (who has time for that, except on special occasions?)  however, using a 9 x 13 pan changes the baking time, and the time given is approximate and based on my experience with a convection oven.  i tend to overbake them a bit because i like shortbread very crisp.

i use enough whole wheat flour to give it a nice color, and to help give the bread more body. i like to mark the bread with a cross, as a symbol and make it so that it is easily broken. we have 2 services, so i make 3 loaves. i pray as i make the loaves, and feel very humble that i am allowed to do this for our church.","['flour', 'whole wheat flour', 'salt', 'sugar', 'butter', 'milk']"
